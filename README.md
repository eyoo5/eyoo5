## Hi, I am Esther Yoo 👋

###  👩🏻‍🏫 Former Teacher Now Turned Coder 👩🏻‍💻
My foundation is in Javascript, but I am an advent learner! You can tell from my repositories that I like to dabble in different frameworks and languages. I am confident in using Node.js and Express with a PostgreSQL database on the backend, and React on the front-end. However, I have tried a little of MongoDB and making desktop application using electron, and pretty soon I will try to do a small project using python!
